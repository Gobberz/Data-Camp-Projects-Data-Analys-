In this project, I analyzed the commercial success of Disney films. An exploratory data analysis was conducted to search for successful film genres by year and movie release trends by month. Finally, I tried working with Confidence Intervals for the regression parameters to answer the question, "Which genres should Disney focus on when making movies?"
